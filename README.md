## I'm a Backend Developer and a Data Engineer

I'd attended DIO's last bootcamp of Python AI Backend Development and that was great. I created a repository with all productions, 
challenges and projects developed all over the course. I hope it's interesting and it can show you some of my skills learned in this time.

I'm adding my new certifications in a repo. If you want to see it, here is the [link](https://github.com/JhonatasMenezes/Certificados).

I'm learning about AI with NEAT lib in Python. There is my first project/contact with AI on a game called Flappy Bird. Check it [here.](https://github.com/JhonatasMenezes/Projetos_Python/tree/main/projetos_IA/flappy_bird)
I'm also learning how to refactor a code and working to do this in the above project.

I worked in a well project, that actually, consisted on create 8 projects being 4 for backend and 4 for their GUI's.
Ther are:
* [Simulador de Dados](https://github.com/JhonatasMenezes/8ProjetosemPython/blob/main/simulador_de_dado.py) üé≤
* [Escolha um N√∫mero](https://github.com/JhonatasMenezes/8ProjetosemPython/blob/main/escolha_um_numero.py) üî¢
* [Decida por Mim](https://github.com/JhonatasMenezes/8ProjetosemPython/blob/main/decida_por_mim.py) üí¨
* [Jogo de Aventura](https://github.com/JhonatasMenezes/8ProjetosemPython/blob/main/jogo_de_aventura.py) üöÄ

Note: the last game are really insteresting, chek it in the repo.


Developed in Python3 and lib PySimpleGUI. üë®‚Äçüíª

I'm say about the codes and experience in the README, so you can better got it.
I hope you like that! Enjoy the repo [here.](https://github.com/JhonatasMenezes/8ProjetosemPython)

I created a complete Database using Oracle 18c with Pl/SQL. See it [here.](https://github.com/JhonatasMenezes/Projeto_FullDataBase_Mercado)
That is the picture of guide text to finish my great and complete first work, creating a DATABASE with all automations.
